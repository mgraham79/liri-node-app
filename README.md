# liri-node-app

This app is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.
<br />The data is being pulled from the Twitter, Spotify, and OMDB API's and can be called using the following parameters which will be displayed in the terminal:
<br />"my-tweets" - will display the last 20 tweets and when they were created.
<br />
<br />"spotify-this-song + <any song>" - this will display the artists, song's name, preview link of the song from Spotify, and the album that the song is from. If no song is selected, it will default to "The Sign".
<br />
<br />"movie-this + <any movie>" - this will display the title of the movie, the year the movie came out, the IMDB rating, Rotton Tomatoes rating, the country the movie was produced, the language of the movie, the plot, and the actors in the movie. If no movie in inputted, it will default to "Mr. Nobody".
<br />
<br />"do-what-it-says" - this will default to "The Sign" in Spotify.
